# Crypto-currency-comparison-using-R-and-shiny
This is a web application for comparison between cryptocurrencies (Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc...) developed using R and shiny(R library for building beautiful dashboards). <br>
I've used different statistical modeling and descriptive statistics for this project and used R programming language. I've created many charts of data and made a visually appealing dashboard so that it can be easy for users to check and get into detail about each topic. I've also used regression for future predictions.
